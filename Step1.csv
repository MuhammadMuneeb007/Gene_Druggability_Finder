ADRB2,ADRB2,adrenoceptor beta 2,"This gene encodes beta-2-adrenergic receptor which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This receptor is directly associated with one of its ultimate effectors, the class C L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1.2. This receptor-channel complex also contains a G protein, an adenylyl cyclase, cAMP-dependent kinase, and the counterbalancing phosphatase, PP2A. The assembly of the signaling complex provides a mechanism that ensures specific and rapid signaling by this G protein-coupled receptor. This receptor is also a transcription regulator of the alpha-synuclein gene, and together, both genes are believed to be associated with risk of Parkinson's Disease. This gene is intronless. Different polymorphic forms, point mutations, and/or downregulation of this gene are associated with nocturnal asthma, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

CHRM3,CHRM3,cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3,"The muscarinic cholinergic receptors belong to a larger family of G protein-coupled receptors. The functional diversity of these receptors is defined by the binding of acetylcholine and includes cellular responses such as adenylate cyclase inhibition, phosphoinositide degeneration, and potassium channel mediation. Muscarinic receptors influence many effects of acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous system. The muscarinic cholinergic receptor 3 controls smooth muscle contraction and its stimulation causes secretion of glandular tissue. Alternative promoter use and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that have different tissue specificities.

The tandem array of 15 N-terminal exons, or variable exons, are followed by downstream C-terminal exons, or constant exons, which are shared by all genes in the cluster. The large, uninterrupted N-terminal exons each encode six cadherin ectodomains while the C-terminal exons encode the cytoplasmic domain. These neural cadherin-like cell adhesion proteins are integral plasma membrane proteins that most likely play a critical role in the establishment and function of specific cell-cell connections in the brain.

EGFR,EGFR,epidermal growth factor receptor,"The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the protein kinase superfamily. This protein is a receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a cell surface protein that binds to epidermal growth factor, thus inducing receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation leading to cell proliferation.

JAK2,JAK2,Janus kinase 2,"This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling. This gene and the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway is a therapeutic target for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to viral infections. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.

JAK1,JAK1,Janus kinase 1,"This gene encodes a membrane protein that is a member of a class of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTK) characterized by the presence of a second phosphotransferase-related domain immediately N-terminal to the PTK domain. The encoded kinase phosphorylates STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and plays a key role in interferon-alpha/beta, interferon-gamma, and cytokine signal transduction. This gene plays a crucial role in effecting the expression of genes that mediate inflammation, epithelial remodeling, and metastatic cancer progression.

FLT3,FLT3,fms related receptor tyrosine kinase 3,"This gene encodes a class III receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates hematopoiesis. This receptor is activated by binding of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand to the extracellular domain, which induces homodimer formation in the plasma membrane leading to autophosphorylation of the receptor. The activated receptor kinase subsequently phosphorylates and activates multiple cytoplasmic effector molecules in pathways involved in apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow. Mutations that result in the constitutive activation of this receptor result in acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

CDK4,CDK4,cyclin dependent kinase 4,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family. This protein is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae cdc28 and S. pombe cdc2. It is a catalytic subunit of the protein kinase complex that is important for cell cycle G1 phase progression. The activity of this kinase is restricted to the G1-S phase, which is controlled by the regulatory subunits D-type cyclins and CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a). This kinase was shown to be responsible for the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene product (Rb). Mutations in this gene as well as in its related proteins including D-type cyclins, p16(INK4a) and Rb were all found to be associated with tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers. Multiple polyadenylation sites of this gene have been reported.

MAPK1,MAPK1,mitogen-activated protein kinase 1,"This gene encodes a member of the MAP kinase family. MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene.

NR3C1,NR3C1,nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1,"This gene encodes glucocorticoid receptor, which can function both as a transcription factor that binds to glucocorticoid response elements in the promoters of glucocorticoid responsive genes to activate their transcription, and as a regulator of other transcription factors. This receptor is typically found in the cytoplasm, but upon ligand binding, is transported into the nucleus. It is involved in inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, and differentiation in target tissues. Mutations in this gene are associated with generalized glucocorticoid resistance.

ACE,ACE,angiotensin I converting enzyme,"This gene encodes an enzyme involved in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance. It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into a physiologically active peptide angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasopressor and aldosterone-stimulating peptide that controls blood pressure and fluid-electrolyte balance. This angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) also inactivates the vasodilator protein, bradykinin. Accordingly, the encoded enzyme increases blood pressure and is a drug target of ACE inhibitors, which are often prescribed to reduce blood pressure. This enzyme additionally plays a role in fertility through its ability to cleave and release GPI-anchored membrane proteins in spermatozoa. Many studies have associated the presence or absence of a 287 bp Alu repeat element in this gene with the levels of circulating enzyme. This polymorphism, as well as mutations in this gene, have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases including cardiovascular pathophysiologies, psoriasis, renal disease, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease. Regulation of the homologous ACE2 gene may be involved in progression of disease caused by several human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding both somatic (sACE) and male-specific testicular (tACE) isoforms.

HMGCR,HMGCR,3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase,"HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis and is regulated via a negative feedback mechanism mediated by sterols and non-sterol metabolites derived from mevalonate, the product of the reaction catalyzed by reductase. Normally in mammalian cells this enzyme is suppressed by cholesterol derived from the internalization and degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) via the LDL receptor. Competitive inhibitors of the reductase induce the expression of LDL receptors in the liver, which in turn increases the catabolism of plasma LDL and lowers the plasma concentration of cholesterol, an important determinant of atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

PTGS2,PTGS2,prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2,"Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS), also known as cyclooxygenase, is the key enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts both as a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase.

ACHE,ACHE,acetylcholinesterase (Yt blood group),"Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface. It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing structural subunits. The other, alternatively spliced form, expressed primarily in the erythroid tissues, differs at the C-terminal end, and contains a cleavable hydrophobic peptide with a GPI-anchor site. It associates with the membranes through the phosphoinositide (PI) moieties added post-translationally. AChE activity may constitute a sensitive biomarker of RBC ageing in vivo, and thus, may be of aid in understanding the effects of transfusion[provided by RefSeq, Sep 2019].",protein-coding,ACEE|ARACHE|N-ACHE|YT,Yt blood group|acetylcholinesterase|acetylcholinesterase (Cartwright blood group)|apoptosis-related acetylcholinesterase,ENSG00000087085,ENST00000241069|ENST00000302913|ENST00000411582|ENST00000412389|ENST00000419336|ENST00000426415|ENST00000428317|ENST00000430554|ENST00000440755|ENST00000441605,ENSP00000241069|ENSP00000303211|ENSP00000390004|ENSP00000394976|ENSP00000396360|ENSP00000397143|ENSP00000399725|ENSP00000400933|ENSP00000403474|ENSP00000404865,P22303,F8WD68|A0A498U6H7|C9JZL6|C9J2S3|C9JD78,ACES_HUMAN,43,NM_000665.5|NM_001282449.2|NM_001302621.3|NM_001302622.2|NM_001367915.1|NM_001367917.1|NM_001367918.1|NM_001367919.2|NM_015831.2|NR_160407.1,NP_000656.1|NP_001269378.1|NP_001289550.1|NP_001289551.1|NP_001354844.1|NP_001354846.1|NP_001354847.1|NP_001354848.1,NC_000007.14|NC_060931.1|NG_007474.2,108,100740,PA20,9606.ENSP00000303211,1B41|1F8U|1VZJ|2X8B|3LII|4BDT|4EY4|4EY5|4EY6|4EY7|4EY8|4M0E|4M0F|4PQE|5FOQ|5FPQ|5HF5|5HF6|5HF8|5HF9,3.1.1.7,IPR000997|IPR002018|IPR014788|IPR019819|IPR019826|IPR029058|IPR050654,PF00135|PF08674,,7,100889994.0,100897022.0,-1.0,614,Synapse|Secreted|Cell membrane,9606,543.0,Acetylcholinesterase,kegg:hsa00564|kegg:hsa04725|reactome:R-HSA-112311|reactome:R-HSA-112315|reactome:R-HSA-112316|reactome:R-HSA-1430728|reactome:R-HSA-1483191|wikipathways:WP3298|wikipathways:WP528|wikipathways:WP550|wikipathways:WP727

VEGFA,VEGFA,vascular endothelial growth factor A,"This gene is a member of the PDGF/VEGF growth factor family. It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines.

STAT3,STAT3,signal transducer and activator of transcription 3,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT protein family. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated through phosphorylation in response to various cytokines and growth factors including IFNs, EGF, IL5, IL6, HGF, LIF and BMP2. This protein mediates the expression of a variety of genes in response to cell stimuli, and thus plays a key role in many cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis. The small GTPase Rac1 has been shown to bind and regulate the activity of this protein. PIAS3 protein is a specific inhibitor of this protein.

The 105 kD protein is a Rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor and the 50 kD protein is a DNA binding subunit of the NF-kappa-B (NFKB) protein complex. NFKB is a transcription regulator that is activated by various intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Activated NFKB translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological functions. Inappropriate activation of NFKB has been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases while persistent inhibition of NFKB leads to inappropriate immune cell development or delayed cell growth. NFKB is a critical regulator of the immediate-early response to viral infection.

HIF1A,HIF1A,hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha,"This gene encodes the alpha subunit of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. HIF-1 functions as a master regulator of cellular and systemic homeostatic response to hypoxia by activating transcription of many genes, including those involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and other genes whose protein products increase oxygen delivery or facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 thus plays an essential role in embryonic vascularization, tumor angiogenesis and pathophysiology of ischemic disease. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified for this gene.

It functions as part of a heterotrimer and interacts with other extracellular matrix components such as perlecans, proteoglycans, and laminins. In addition, proteolytic cleavage of the non-collagenous carboxy-terminal domain results in a biologically active fragment known as arresten, which has anti-angiogenic and tumor suppressor properties.

TRAF6,TRAF6,TNF receptor associated factor 6,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) protein family. TRAF proteins are associated with, and mediate signal transduction from, members of the TNF receptor superfamily. This protein has an amino terminal RING domain which is followed by four zinc-finger motifs, a central coiled-coil region and a highly conserved carboxyl terminal domain, known as the TRAF-C domain and mediates signaling from members of the TNF receptor superfamily as well as the Toll/IL-1 family. Signals from receptors such as CD40, TNFSF11/RANCE and IL-1 have been shown to be mediated by this protein. This protein also interacts with various protein kinases including IRAK1/IRAK, SRC and PKCzeta, which provides a link between distinct signaling pathways. This protein functions as a signal transducer in the NF-kappaB pathway that activates IkappaB kinase (IKK) in response to proinflammatory cytokines. The interaction of this protein with UBE2N/UBC13, and UBE2V1/UEV1A, which are ubiquitin conjugating enzymes catalyzing the formation of polyubiquitin chains, has been found to be required for IKK activation by this protein. This protein also interacts with the transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptor complex and is required for Smad-independent activation of the JNK and p38 kinases. The protein encoded by this gene is a key molecule in antiviral innate and antigen-specific immune responses.

This gene encodes a member of the L15E family of ribosomal proteins and a component of the 60S subunit. This gene shares sequence similarity with the yeast ribosomal protein YL10 gene. Elevated expression of this gene has been observed in esophageal tumors and gastric cancer tissues, and deletion of this gene has been observed in a Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) patient. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.

RPS19,RPS19,ribosomal protein S19,"Ribosomes, the organelles that catalyze protein synthesis, consist of a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is a component of the 40S subunit. The protein belongs to the S19E family of ribosomal proteins. It is located in the cytoplasm. Mutations in this gene cause Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a constitutional erythroblastopenia characterized by absent or decreased erythroid precursors, in a subset of patients. This suggests a possible extra-ribosomal function for this gene in erythropoietic differentiation and proliferation, in addition to its ribosomal function. Higher expression levels of this gene in some primary colon carcinomas compared to matched normal colon tissues has been observed. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.
